# qbittorrent exporter
A kotlin-based, prometheus exporter for qBittorrent that relies on qBittorrent's web ui. This
exporter exposes all statistics available through the qBt web ui, but also provides in-depth
configuration of each available metric.

#### Huh?
 - [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) - a "free and reliable P2P bittorrent client" that's
   open source.
 - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) - a feature-complete metrics database that's open source.
 - Exporter - with respect to prometheus, a web server that exposes metrics.

To be added: Screenshots/features, download/usage, and configuration.
